# ast
This is the AT&amp;T Software Technology ast software download site from AT&amp;T Research. The AT&amp;T AST OpenSource Software Collection provides an overview and Practical Reusable UNIX Software provides a historical perspective. You can join the ast and uwin mailgroups, or monitor the mail archives. There is also an AT&amp;T internal talk. The man page index contains most of the ast commands and library functions; command man pages are also available at runtime using the --man or --html option of any ast command.
